<h2>Single Statement Stages of Change Questionnaire</h2>
<p><i>These next questions help us better understand the way you view your amputation-related problems. Each statement describes how you may feel about these particular problems. After I read the statement, please tell me if you agree or disagree with the statement. Okay?</i></p>
