			<h2>Psychosocial Treatment Compliance Scale</h2>
			<p><i>The degree of psychosocial treatment compliance for people with mental illness is examined by the mental health care professionals, such as occupational therapists, social workers and nurses, etc. The term ‘therapists’ stated below refers to all these rofessionals. Scoring on level of compliance is based on clients’ overall performances in various psychosocial treatments, including family intervention, social skills training, vocational rehabilitation and cognitive behavioural therapy, etc., for the past THREE months.</i></p>
