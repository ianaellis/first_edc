<h2>SPSI-R - Problem Solving</h2>
	<p><i>Below are some ways that you might think, feel, and act when faced with PROBLEMS in everyday living. We are not talking about the common hassles and pressures that you handle successfully every day. In this questionnaire, a problem is something important in your life that bothers you a lot but you don't immediately know how to make it better or stop it from bothering you so much. The problem could be something about yourself (such as your thoughts, feelings, behavior, appearance, or health), your relationships with other people (such as your family, friends, teachers, or boss), or your environment and the things that you own (such as your house, car, property, money). Please Read each statement carefully and choose one of the numbers below which shows how much the statement is true of you. See yourself as yo uusually think, feel and act when you are faced with important problems in your life these days. Put the number that you choose on the line before the statement.</i></p>
